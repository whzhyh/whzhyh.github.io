<li><p>Sales drives in big organizations, many a times, fall flat on the face. A research showed that an average buyer remembers only 20% of the things discussed during a sales call. The saddest part is that the sales team doesn’t get to choose what those 20% of things would be. The world today is cluttered with information and thus it is essential that the sales team represents their product/service in the best possible manner. It is like answering questions that children ask. Expect basic and out of context questions and reply to each one of them. patiently, in a way that the customers understand the intricacies. You can use technical terms to explain your product and its features. No doubt, it will be an accurate methodology but certainly not the right one. Simplify your message and see how well your client remembers you and your presentation when you meet hime to finally close the deal.</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] A regular buyer would remember more than 20% of the details after a sales meeting.</li>
<li>[ ] A customer is as gullible as a child and hence may ask many questions.</li>
<li>[x] A better sales person would be the one who is able to explain the features of his/her product in a simple manner.</li>
<li>[ ] If you simplify your message, the customer would remember your entire presentation.</li>
